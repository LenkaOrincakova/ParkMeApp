# ParkMe
ParkMe is an android application, targeting people who are struggling to find free parking spot. The app is monitoring every parking place, whether it is paid or not. The user is able to search for any city within Denmark to search for a free parking places near their location, or location chosen by the user. With this app, user can easily find the best spot for his car and moreover, pin the car to a specific parking spot in case of crowded places. The ParkMe app is using location as a web service and registering the account with your google account. Favourite parking places are saved into database. 
## Why it's important?
Searching for a parking spot is usually a huge issue especially in the centres and sometimes it causes car accidents because drivers are in rush and they are trying to decide where to go. It's often time consuming and frustrating and this app should help every driver to avoid getting fines for parking :)
